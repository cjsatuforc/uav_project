uav_project
===========

An attempt to create software for use with a basic drone platform, an Arduino of sorts and a Raspberry Pi

Aim: to create a UAV which can operate without user intervention other than to determine destination or mission.

Additional aims: to be able to manage with electronic and software failures.

My Background
==============

I am an electronic engineer with experience designing high reliability electronic control systems for jet engines. While on a graduate scheme, I started to look at the control system for an aged model of the V22 Osprey aircraft (used by US Marine Corp). This was designed to operate in a manner similar to an electronic engine controller (EEC) and so have redundancy built in. It struck me that this code could form the basis for a UAV design with another layer of control added. 

If you wish to use any of my code then please tell me what you are using it for.
