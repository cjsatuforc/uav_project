Basis
=====

This control scheme will use micro-controllers for low level motor control, stability and similar functionality. A Raspberry Pi or similar linux based micro-computer will be used to determine overall control of direction and communicating to the operator. A dual lane control system will be introduced. This will allow any software failures in a micro-controller or micro-computer to not be catastrophic. I do not see the micro-controllers being prone to software failure which is not due to programmer error. As a result, the focus will be on the micro-computer. Some element of health checking will also need to be introduced. This could simply be reading a signal which is present when the micro-controller is powered or running an operating function. 

There are limitations to this design. They are mostly related to added complications or increased weight with little gain. However, as the unit will not be able to fail safe during flight then being able to change controls will help avoid damage to the UAV. This would mean doubling up on all controls, motor drivers and what not.
